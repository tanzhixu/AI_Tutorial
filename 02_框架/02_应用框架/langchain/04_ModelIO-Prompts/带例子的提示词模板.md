### Few-shot 提示词模版
在本教程中，我们将学习如何创建使用少量示例的提示模板。可以从一组示例或示例选择器对象构建少量提示模板

#### 创建示例
首先，创建一个很少使用的示例列表。每个示例都应该是一个字典，键是输入变量，值是这些输入变量的值。


```python
from langchain_core.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

examples = [
    {
        "question": "Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
""",
    },
    {
        "question": "When was the founder of craigslist born?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
So the final answer is: December 6, 1952
""",
    },
    {
        "question": "Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
""",
    },
    {
        "question": "Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?",
        "answer": """
Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
Intermediate Answer: The United States.
Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?
Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.
So the final answer is: No
""",
    },
]
```

#### 创建提示词模版
配置一个格式化程序，将少数示例格式化为字符串。此格式化程序应该是PromptTemplate对象


```python
example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["question", "answer"], template="Question: {question}\n{answer}"
)

print(example_prompt.format(**examples[0]))
```

    Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
    Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
    Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
    Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
    So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
    
    

#### 将示例和格式化程序提供给FewShotPromptTemplate
最后，创建一个FewShotPromptTemplate对象。该对象接收少量示例和少量示例的格式化程序


```python
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    examples=examples,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    suffix="Question: {input}",
    input_variables=["input"],
)

print(prompt.format(input="Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"))
```

    Question: Who lived longer, Muhammad Ali or Alan Turing?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: How old was Muhammad Ali when he died?
    Intermediate answer: Muhammad Ali was 74 years old when he died.
    Follow up: How old was Alan Turing when he died?
    Intermediate answer: Alan Turing was 41 years old when he died.
    So the final answer is: Muhammad Ali
    
    
    Question: When was the founder of craigslist born?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who was the founder of craigslist?
    Intermediate answer: Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark.
    Follow up: When was Craig Newmark born?
    Intermediate answer: Craig Newmark was born on December 6, 1952.
    So the final answer is: December 6, 1952
    
    
    Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
    Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
    So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
    
    
    Question: Are both the directors of Jaws and Casino Royale from the same country?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who is the director of Jaws?
    Intermediate Answer: The director of Jaws is Steven Spielberg.
    Follow up: Where is Steven Spielberg from?
    Intermediate Answer: The United States.
    Follow up: Who is the director of Casino Royale?
    Intermediate Answer: The director of Casino Royale is Martin Campbell.
    Follow up: Where is Martin Campbell from?
    Intermediate Answer: New Zealand.
    So the final answer is: No
    
    
    Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
    

#### 使用模版选择器
我们将使用上一节中的示例集和格式化程序。但是，我们不会将示例直接输入到FewShotPromptTemplate对象中，而是将它们输入到示例选择器对象中。

下例中，我们将使用SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector类，该类根据其与输入的相似性选择few-shot示例，它使用嵌入模型来计算输入和示例之间的相似性，以及向量存储来执行最邻近搜索

由于使用OpenAIEmbeddings需要key，所以本例中使用OllamaEmbeddings量化模型，并需要事先下载nomic-embed-text

ollama pull nomic-embed-text

需事先安装如下模块：
pip install langchain_chroma


```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_core.example_selectors import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain_community.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings

example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(
    # This is the list of examples available to select from.
    examples,
    # This is the embedding class used to produce embeddings which are used to measure semantic similarity.
    OllamaEmbeddings(model='nomic-embed-text'),
    # This is the VectorStore class that is used to store the embeddings and do a similarity search over.
    Chroma,
    # This is the number of examples to produce.
    k=1,
)

# Select the most similar example to the input.
question = "Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"
selected_examples = example_selector.select_examples({"question": question})
print(f"Examples most similar to the input: {question}")
for example in selected_examples:
    print("\n")
    for k, v in example.items():
        print(f"{k}: {v}")
```

    Examples most similar to the input: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
    
    
    answer: 
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
    Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
    So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
    
    question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?
    

#### 将示例选择器输入FewShotPromptTemplate
最后，创建一个FewShotPromptTemplate对象。该对象接受示例选择器和少数示例的格式化程序。



```python
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    example_selector=example_selector,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    suffix="Question: {input}",
    input_variables=["input"],
)

print(prompt.format(input="Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?"))
```

    Question: Who was the maternal grandfather of George Washington?
    
    Are follow up questions needed here: Yes.
    Follow up: Who was the mother of George Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The mother of George Washington was Mary Ball Washington.
    Follow up: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
    Intermediate answer: The father of Mary Ball Washington was Joseph Ball.
    So the final answer is: Joseph Ball
    
    
    Question: Who was the father of Mary Ball Washington?
